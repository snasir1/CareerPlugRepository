For my client, I developed an Android application using Android Studio and programmed it in Java. The application utilized Firebase Authentication for email, phone, and Google Sign-in options and used the Firebase Database to help the application store, update, and retrieve data in real-time. Furthermore, I created a clean and easy-to use UI, that included Login and Signup screens, a Profile, Discover, and Interests pages, and Sorting and Filter Options for the users. The applicationâ€™s main purpose was to let users easily find programs, events, internships, and other job opportunities based on their grade level and career interests.
