# CareerPlugRepository
For my client, I developed CareerPlug, a user-friendly Android app on Google Play with 1000+ downloads. Integrated Firebase Authentication (Email, Phone, Google Sign-In) and Firebase Cloud Messaging for secure authentication and instant notifications. Seamlessly migrated customer data to Firebase Realtime Database. Created a user-friendly interface with login, signup, profile management, program discovery, and interests customization screens. Empowered users with easy access to tailored programs, events, internships, and job opportunities based on their academic level and career interests.
