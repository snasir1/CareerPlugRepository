For my client, I developed an Android application using Android Studio and Java, incorporating Firebase Authentication for secure login (email, phone, Google Sign-in) and Firebase Database for real-time data storage and retrieval. Created a user-friendly interface with screens for login, signup, profile management, program discovery, and interests customization. Facilitated easy access to tailored programs, events, internships, and job opportunities based on user's academic level and career interests.
